# Activity-3--Activity-1--
My activity 1 resubmit for the activity 3 assignment! This is my own work.

What did you learn?

I learned how to properly save a project as a repository in github. 
I also learned to ask questions early so I do not run out of time and not get all of my points.

What were the challenges if any?
The main challenge I had was keeping track of what files needed to go into the github repository.
